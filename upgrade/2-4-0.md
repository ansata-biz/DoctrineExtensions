# Upgrade from 2.3.x to 2.4.0

## Translatable

- Translatable was refactored completely and data migration is necessary. Read the **doc/translatable.md**

## Sluggable

- If there was a listener method **addManagedFilter** used anywhere in your code. You should change it to
**addFilterToIgnore** which takes a filter classname as a parameter. These filters will be ignored during slug
persistence. The general purpose was to support **Softdeleteable**

## Tree

### NestedSet

- now works together with **Softdeleteable** updates node lft - rgt values even if node was softdeleted, so later it
could be restored.

## General changes which should not impact your code:

- All class names like **Loggable - logEntryClass** supports now relative class names as everywhere else in orm mapping.
